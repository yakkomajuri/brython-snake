-> can you please elaborate on what these px, py, tc, gs, ax, ay, trail, tail variables refer to! all i could understand was px and py referred to the snakes x any y coordinates, ax and ay is the food, tail is the last element of the snake and trail could be the body. I am totally confused about what tc and gs does!! 
it would be really great if you could either edit the readme with some guidance or please mail me @ pranavraki@gmail.com
